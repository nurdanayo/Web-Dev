No one starts as a pro — we all begin at <strong>zero</strong>.<br>
You trip, you pause, you try again — that’s <em>normal</em>.<br>
<br>
Practice builds your brain like training builds muscles.<br>
Mistakes don’t mean “I’m bad” — they mean <strong>I’m learning</strong>.<br>
<br>
Step by step, you get better — quietly, stubbornly, for real.<br>
And one day you realize: <em>you can learn anything</em>.
