    <h1>Night Shift in My Head</h1>

<p>
I collect <em>tiny</em> wins like coins in my pocket,<br>
and spend them on courage when days feel chaotic.<br>
<br>
My plans are messy, but my aim is <strong>clear</strong>,<br>
I learn, I fail, I come back—still here.<br>
<br>
If the world gets loud, I don’t disappear—<br>
I turn the noise into lines you can hear.
